//polymorphism(virtual methods)
// the polymorphic call mechanism will determine the correct implementation for the member 
// function, depending on the exact class of the instance pointed to by the contract 
// pointer. 

//Virtual Table:-
// polymorphism allows for more flexible and dynamic behavior in OOP, enabling code reuse and extensibility. 
// Virtual tables (vtables) are the underlying mechanism that supports runtime polymorphism by associating 
// function calls with the correct method implementations based on the actual object type, rather than the
//  reference type, ensuring that overridden methods are properly invoked at runtime.


//destructor use for class and also for virtual function
// Once a virtual destructor has been declared in the base class, all descendant classes 
// will also contain a virtual destructor, independent of using the virtual keyword. This 
// is guaranteed by the presence of a virtual table containing the address of the destructor
